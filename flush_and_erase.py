"""
flush_and_erase.py — one-shot tool to pull EVERY stored record off the
Particle Plus counter into the local archive CSV, then (optionally) erase
the counter's memory.

SAFETY MODEL — the counter is erased ONLY when every one of these passes:
  1. We can connect to the counter.
  2. We can read the record count, and it is > 0.
     (A failed/again read ABORTS — it is never silently treated as "empty".)
  3. EVERY record reads back successfully AND its latched record_number matches
     the record we asked for. Any failure → abort, nothing erased.
  4. The records are appended to the archive CSV, and the write is then
     VERIFIED by re-reading the file and confirming it grew by exactly the
     expected number of rows AND that those rows are the records we just read.
  5. Only then, and only if ERASE_AFTER_SYNC is True, is the counter erased,
     and the erase is itself verified (count returns to 0).

At any anomaly the tool aborts WITHOUT erasing — data is never lost.

NETWORK RESILIENCE: every modbus call is retried with exponential backoff and
an automatic reconnect between attempts (TIMEOUT / MODBUS_RETRIES / READ_RETRIES
below). This rides out a flaky link — but note that nothing can overcome heavy
packet loss (e.g. ~77% loss seen from a cluster login node). Run this from a
host with a stable path to the counter (e.g. noether / the cleanroom subnet).

This script REUSES the proven modbus / CSV / erase functions from
particle_plus.py, so the archive schema always matches the daemon's (no
column drift / corruption). particle_plus.py is imported, never modified.

Runs from any computer / working directory:
