emergency_erase.py - FORCE ERASE counter regardless of archive status

⚠️  DANGER: This erases ALL data from the counter WITHOUT checking archive!
    Use this ONLY when you want to completely wipe the counter and start fresh.

Use cases:
  - You know the counter has stale/corrupted data
  - You're starting a completely fresh installation
  - The counter has data from testing/debugging that you don't want

DO NOT use this for normal operation! Use particle_plus.py --trim instead.
